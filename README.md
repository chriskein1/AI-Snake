# AI SNAKE
# by Chris Keiningham

My fully object-oriented implementation of the classic game Snake in C++, with an Artificial Intelligence spin!
Uses the classic A* pathfinding algorithm.
Made using SFML.

# Features

Normal / AI play
Normal bounds includes collision detection as intended.
AI play has no collision.
AI play includes a debug console, which shows the searched cells as well as the path chosen.

# Keybinds
1 - normal speed <br />
2 - 2x speed <br />

4 - 6x speed <br />
